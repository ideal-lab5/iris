# Proxy Pallet

The proxy pallet provides the mechanism for nodes to become proxy nodes within the Iris network.
While Iris remains a proof of authority network and has not yet implemented a threshold encrypted system, we stipulate that only authorities have the right to become proxies.

## Becoming a Proxy

To become a proxy node, an authority must stake 100 IRIS.
