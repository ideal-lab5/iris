# Iris-Ledger

The Iris  Ledger facilitates the management of funds for iris nodes. In particular, it allows nodes to lock funds, unlock funds, and transfer them to a address. We expose this functionality via our chain extension in order to make this functionality easily callable within smart contracts.
